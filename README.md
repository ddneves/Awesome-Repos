# Awesome-Repos [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ogwurujohnson/Awesome-Repos) 

A curated list of awesome repositories, we come across and are tempted to fork. Instead of having forked repositories littered all around our GitHub accounts, how does the idea of having a single repository with all your favorite repositories and also other awesome repositories/projects you had no idea existed, sound?

# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines]() first.

I will keep some pull requests open if I'm not sure whether those repositories are awesome, you could [vote for them](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pulls) by adding :+1: to them. Pull requests will be merged when their votes reach **20**.
