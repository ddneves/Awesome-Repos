# Awesome-Repos [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re) 

A curated list of awesome repositories, we come across and are tempted to fork. Instead of having forked repositories littered all around our GitHub accounts, how does the idea of having a single repository with all your favorite repositories and also other awesome repositories/projects or even learning resources in form of repos you had no idea existed, sound?

# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines]() first.

I will keep some pull requests open if I'm not sure whether those repositories are awesome, you could [vote for them](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pulls) by adding :+1: to them. Pull requests will be merged when their votes reach **20**.
